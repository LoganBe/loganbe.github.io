    <!-- What is Neuro -->
    <h3> <b> What is Neuroscience? </b> </h3>
    Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on studying the structure and function of the brain. The
    brain harbors an immense number of mysteries that we still do not yet understand such as: What causes neurological
    issues such as epilepsy or Alzheimer’s? How does the brain process information about the environment? What is
    consciousness? These questions have inspired people from a variety fields of study, such as biology, physics,
    psychology,
    computer science, engineering, and mathematics, to come together in the attempt to understand how the brain works.
    <br> <br>

    <!-- Our Mission -->
    <h3> <b> Our Mission </b></h3>
    We want to bring Neuroscience to you! The brain is something we all have, and we should all become a little bit more
    familiar with it. That is where we come in. Here at the University of Texas at Austin we have a committed and
    dedicated group of graduate students from within the Institute of Neuroscience that aim to share their knowledge
    about the brain with everyone. These are students who have extensively studied the brain, as well
    are currently
    doing their own research! We offer a free program called NeuReach that is open to all schools, for all ages, where
    we bring in hands-on Neuroscience demonstrations, and presenations, that aim to both educate as well as inspire
    students to pursue STEM education.

      <h5>
        <li>
          Neuroscience Demonstrations:
        </li>
      </h5>
      Ever want to take control of another person’s nervous system? Or perhaps you want to get a closer look at the
      brain and explore its complex anatomy? Through our neuroscience demonstrations we can do just that! Here we
      provide an opportunity for students to get hands on exposure to neuroscience-based studies where they can get a
      deeper
      understanding of both the brain physiology and function. Currently our program has 3 modules that are outlined
      below, with more demonstrations coming soon.
      <br><br>
      <b>Length</b>: 3, 15-minute-long demonstrations, rotated in groups of 3.
      <br><br>
      <b>Location</b>: Need a larger space where students can move around and have easy access to observe the stations.
      <br><br>
      <b>Target Demographic</b>: All Ages
      <br><br>
      <b>Activities</b>:
      <ol type='i'>
        <li>
          <b>Brain Anatomy</b>: For this demonstration, our expert guides the students through the anatomy of a sheep
          brain,
          going through the different lobes and functions of the major cortical regions. With our provided gloves the
          students are able to hold and examine the provided brains. During this time the expert
          will also be available to answer questions about the brain that the students may be curious about.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Electrical Activity of Nerves</b>: The brain sends signals throughout the body through electrical signals.
          In this
          demonstration will first have an expert demonstrate to the students this process by viewing electromyograms
          (EMGs) of their own muscle activity. We will then demonstrate how nerves react to electrical signals by
          allowing one to participate to take over another person’s nervous system! This is done by transferring the
          electrical muscle activity from one participate to the Ulnar nerve (located near the elbow) of another
          participant,
          causing a nerve reflex!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Visual Adaptation</b>: Our brains are amazingly flexible and can adapt to most situations. For example, if
          we
          change
          our visual fields the brain can compensate for the changes and adjust our hand-eye coordination to match the
          new visual field. In this demonstration we will go through the idea of adaptation in the brain and then allow
          the students to have a first-hand experience with the concept. We provide the students with prism goggles that
          will distort the visual field and then ask the students to throw a ball into a bin. As they continue to throw
          the ball, their brain will adapt to the new visual field and allow them to easily make the ball into bin after
          just a few attempts!

        Observation-Question-Hypothesis-Experiment-Analysis-Conclusion. The scientific method has been around since the
        17th century and is still taught around schools across the world today. The scientific process teaches us how to
        properly ask and answer questions and is not just applicable towards science but is used by everyone on a daily
        purpose.
        <br><br>
        In this talk, we will go through the scientific process in detail, exploring how the process is not always
        a straight path, but depends on the questions one might be curious about and how it can be modified based on
        ones
        needs. We will then show real life examples of how the scientific process is being used in science today by
        looking at neuroscience experiments being conducted at UT Austin today. <div class="container text-center">

        The universe is filled with unanswered questions and it is our job as scientists to delve into these mysteries
        and extract the truth. The journey to become a scientist varies from person-to-person, each with their own
        diverse background filled with learning and experimenting. Although there is no one path, we are lucky to have a
        group of students who each have their own experience, with their own set of tips and tricks that they learned
        along the way. In this talk/discussion, we select a wide range of graduate students, varying in education
        background,
        research
        interests, and academic paths, to come have a discussion with high school students about their personal
        journeies to
        becoming a scientist. The talk includes, but is not limited to, information around undergraduate college
        experiences, choosing a field of science to study, how to get involved in research, and the in-and-outs of
        academia. This talk aims to be a discussion where we open the floor to the students to ask us questions
        regarding our personal journies and how they can make steps to becoming a scientests.
