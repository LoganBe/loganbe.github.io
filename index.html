          <class="card-text">Logan received his bachelors in science at Stony Brook University in 2017 for both
            Physics and Astronomy. Afterwards he continued his education at Stony Brook where he obtained his Masters in
            Neuroscience and Behavior in 2019 while working under Dr. Memming Park. His masters thesis focused on
            developing a novel stochastic model that can capture a wide breath of spiking variability that can be tuned
            to both over- and under-dispersed firing behavior. During the time of his Masters, Logan interned at Dr.
            Mathew Wilsons lab at MIT, working under Dr. Carmen Varela where he analyzed the pharmacological effects of
            non-benzodiazepines (eszopiclone and zolpidem) on hippocampal LIF ripple activity. Currently Logan is
            enrolled as a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin where he is working under Dr. Thibaud
            Taillefumier.

          <h2 class="card-title">Research Interest</h2>
          <class="card-text">Logans scientific interest is focused on the development of biophysically inspired models
            that leverages statistical methods to explain neural processes. Specifically, Logans current work is
            centered around understanding neural variability. It is commonly observed and accepted that neurons fire at
            near random time intervals, of which this spiking variability is hypothesized to be due to the fluctuations
            present in the underlying membrane potential. Traditional models explain the irregularity through
            asynchronous balanced networks. These models have shown success at properly describing the spiking
            variability but often lack a valid description of the underlying membrane potential fluctuations. Our work
            aims to extend these models and incorporate low-level synchronized inputs which is hypothesized to provide a
            more biophysically accurate depiction of the neural networks observed in vivo.
